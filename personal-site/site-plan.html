      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you want to get better at running but struggle to find a training plan that not only 
        helps you achieve your potential but also stay healthy? Running is difficult, and it can be very 
        hard to understand the nuances of how certain training plans will maximize your abilities, help 
        you achieve your goals and most importantly keep you healthy and injury free. That is why it is 
        our goal to help everyone achieve their running dreams! Instead of seeking an expensive private 
        coach, our company will help you create a unique and powerful training plan. Our website will 
        offer users simple but effective tools as they work towards their running goals. This includes free 
        training plans that are tailor made for you, as well as access to professionals that can help you 
        adjust your plan as you encounter hurdles on your training journey. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is targeted towards young athletes but running should be for everyone who wants to get 
        better at it! This website allows anyone access to training plans and advice that you would normally 
        get from a coach. If you commit than we will too, anyone is welcome! We will try our very best to a 
        offer a personalized experience for any customer and help to keep you healthy and strong. Our workouts
